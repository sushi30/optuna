## Note to the questioner

If you are more comfortable with [Stack Overflow], you may consider posting your question there instead.
Alternatively, for issues that would benefit from more of an interactive session with the developers,
you may refer to the `#general` channel in the [chainer slack] or the [chainer-jp slack] (Japanese) Slack workspaces.
